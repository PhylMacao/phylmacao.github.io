Starting training can be hard. Additionally if you like to complicate things and want to optimize your progress it can be a bit messy. If you have a broad field of interest like me it is guaranteed to become a mess.

I decided to make a training program. But who am I to make this interesting and worthwhile to you?

I got my BSc in Molecular Bionics Engineering in 2018. The most important thing I learned at university is... the fact that sedentary life destroys you. I came from the countryside so as a child I was always moving. After 2-3 years of walking to buy groceries and the occasional university P.E. courses being 90% of my physical activities I started to feel like an old man, weak and exhausted. I started feeling pain in my back and knees occasionally. I realized things are not OK.
And so my journey started. In the last ~3 years I tried out many movement and training forms including kung fu, tai ji, calisthenics and lifting weights. Last year I became an EQF Level 3 Fitness Instructor to have some official basis for my knowledge. My information comes from my martial arts instructors, the fitness instructor course and in a great part from internet.

Actually (I believe) the internet has every information you need to start training. There are many great athletes/instructors/enthusiasts who make their knowledge freely accessible on Youtube or in some other way. 

## Enter FLOPS training
The world is currently still locked and we can't know how long will this persist. I need a training plan and so might you. In the following months I'll start building a whole route that follows my training philosophy and potentially can be followed from a beginner state.

This raises the question: What is my training philosophy?
Instead of writing a manifesto and taking away time from developing the routines I'll summarize it in a couple of points:
- If you're not training for a specific sport your training should be focused on generally improving attributes and skills to maximize quality of life improvement
- Find things that you find interesting and/or cool. Find ways you can train (for) them because they are what will make you stick to your training. Expanding this the next point:
- Training can include non-physical activities like meditation and memory training. This is why I don't call it exercising.

If this sounds interesting I recommend watching this video from # Adam Sinicki AKA The Bioneer, who is a major inspiration for me:

I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.

From the next post I'll start writing about actual training ideas and my experience incorporating them. Until then if you don't train anything at the moment go out for a walk or if you are stuck inside - put on some music and dance a bit.
